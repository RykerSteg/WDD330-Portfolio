        I was unaware that there is a soft equality check and a hard equality check. Having recently taken a class in python I haove only been using the == comparision to determine equality. I was unaware that in javascript this does not take in the data type. I need to make sure that I use the === or hard data type in order to evaluate the data type as well and that data.
