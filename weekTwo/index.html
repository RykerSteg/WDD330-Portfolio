        <h1>Notes and questions week 2</h1>
        I was unaware that there is a soft equality check and a hard equality check. Having recently taken a class in python I haove only been using the == comparision to determine equality. I was unaware that in javascript this does not take in the data type. I need to make sure that I use the === or hard data type in order to evaluate the data type as well and that data.

        It is important to note that, when calling a value in an array, the array starts at zero(not one). This means that the first value in the array would be accessed with array[0], whereas array[1] would access the second value and so on. 

        <h4>Functions</h4>
        There are three common ways to declare a function. Before reading this I was mostly only aware of one. 
        The first defined in this chapter is the one I am most familiar with and is the name function. This is done by writing function name(){code for the function}
        The second way defined in the reading is to declare an anonymous function within a variable. This is done by writing const variable = function(){code for the function}
        The third way as defined by the reading is to declare a function using the Function() constructor. This appears to be the least efficient way to declare a function as it allows for more issues to arise than the others.
        
        When invoking a function it is important to use parentheses even when the function is assigned to a variable. I found this interesting because I had assumed that one of the advantages to assigning a function to a variable would in fact be the ability to simply call the variable to invoke it.
