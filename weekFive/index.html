        <h3>Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <p>Testing and debugging are essential for creating succint and well designed code. Without testing it seems there would be a lot of things that may be missed or just run improperly.</p>
        <p>I have mostly done testing in the browser so I don't have a ton of experience with writing actual functions that test the code but I can see how they would better the final product if implemented.</p>
        <p>Test driven development or TDD sounds like a good idea in theory but seems like it may be a little difficult to pull off completely to a tee. I find it hard to wrap my head around creating functions to test functions that have yet to be written.</p>
