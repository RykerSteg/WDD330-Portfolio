        <h3>Client-Side form Validation</h3>
        <p>Client-side validation is essentially a pre check before a form is submitted. This allows for the the data input to be checked and changed without having to be submitted. This creates a better user experience.</p>
        <p>Obviously, when it comes to convenience, using built-in form validation is preferred. It seems to be a little simpler and easier to write. </p>
        <p>I really like the ability to style elements accourding to their validity. I like the user experience that this provides.</p>

        <h3>Fetch API</h3>
        <p>So the first thing that catches my attention is the async before the function examples used here. What does that mean? I searched on my own and only found that it allows the program to continue without having to wait on the result of the function.</p>
        <p>It seems that the fetch api provides a way to retrieve a reference to a data file and then to use it.</p>
        <p>I had to find another source to better understand this as there seemed to be a lot that kind of blew by me. But essentially, fetch "fetches" a file and then can display it.</p>
