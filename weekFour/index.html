        <h3>Chapter 15 Modern JS</h3>
        <p>According to what I understand from the reading, it seems more effective to create ones own personalized library of small parts to use in JS rather than using another library. It seems like it might be more of an issue to have to learn the new library and pick out what is and isn't applicable to your page or program.</p>
        <p>Additionally, modules or modular code seems to accomplish the same goal. That is, keeping code succint and not including wasted code that might slow down the programs or pages.</p>
        <p>Importing modules is done with this syntax: import {module} from 'file.name'</p>
        <p>Would it be bad to export all the functions or variables from a module and then only import the needed ones to your file?</p>
        <p>It looks like using default exports makes your code more readable, but only one can be designated per module.</p>
        <p>The MVC style seems to be similar to programming with classes. MVC just has three main classes that encompass the program, these being Model, Viewer, and Controller.</p>
