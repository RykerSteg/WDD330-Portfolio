        <h1>Notes and questions week 4</h1>
        <h3>Forms</h3>
        <p>Forms seem to be a main method in getting data from the user. With JavaScript this data can them be applied to the program and create a output or an interaction with the user.</p>
        <p>In the chapter it was stated that a reset button in not great for usability. I can see this but I can also see the issue one might have with needing to remove information from a form in a desire to start over and having to go through each individual input to remove and change it.</p>
        <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
        <p>This seems really similar the using classes in the python language. I like the idea of creating a parent class that and then pass on its methods to a child class. I also see the value in being able to 'borrow' methods from another class without having to inherit all of that classes methods. I think it could get bulky and quite confusing if a long chain of inheritance is used.</p>
        <p>I like the idea of mixins as well. Are these similar to mixins used in CSS? It appears so. I like being able to create little building blocks of code and then use them to create the program as a whole.</p>
        <h3>Chapter 15 Modern JS</h3>
        <p>According to what I understand from the reading, it seems more effective to create ones own personalized library of small parts to use in JS rather than using another library. It seems like it might be more of an issue to have to learn the new library and pick out what is and isn't applicable to your page or program.</p>
        <p>Additionally, modules or modular code seems to accomplish the same goal. That is, keeping code succint and not including wasted code that might slow down the programs or pages.</p>
        <p>Importing modules is done with this syntax: import {module} from 'file.name'</p>
        <p>Would it be bad to export all the functions or variables from a module and then only import the needed ones to your file?</p>
        <p>It looks like using default exports makes your code more readable, but only one can be designated per module.</p>
        <p>The MVC style seems to be similar to programming with classes. MVC just has three main classes that encompass the program, these being Model, Viewer, and Controller.</p>
        <p>I am intereseted in learning more about React and Vue.js. They seem liek usefull ways to implement the viewer portion of MVC and from what I have seen they are sought after in the current job market.</p>
