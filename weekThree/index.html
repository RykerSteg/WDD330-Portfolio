        <h1>Notes and questions week 3</h1>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model. It seems to basically consist of getting an element and then manipulating it so that it does what we intend it to do. I like this becuase it seems fairly easy to follow using the Document syntax. 
            Based on the reading. The uses of getElementById and querySelector seem the be the most effective ways to use this.

        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>Events and event listeners have always been a little complex in my mind. I really like how it is explained here. Essentially we are making the computer watch for something specific. This is done with the Event Listener. If we add and event listener, and tell it to listen for a click, we can make something happen when that event occurs.</p>
        <p>There are different events for touch events and keyboard or mouse events. Some seem to be usable on both but others are more specific to the device and it is important to make sure that we account for this when writing code. </p>
        <p>I was unaware that when you clicked on an element, you clicked on all of the elements that it is nested inside of. Event porpagation is the order in which the elements are affected. It looks like there are two different ways that this happens. Bubbling and Capturing.</p>
        <p>Bubbling starts with the clicked element and then bubbles up the document. Capturing starts with the root element and then moves downwards to each child element until it reaches the clicked element.</p>
