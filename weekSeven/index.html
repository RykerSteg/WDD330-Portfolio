        <h3>Further Functions</h3>
        <p>Pure Functions have to follow three rules:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The return value should only depend on the values provided as arguments. It can't rely on values from somewhere else.</li>
            <li>There are no side-effects, in other words it only makes non-destructive data transformations and returns new values.</li>
            <li>The third rule is referential transparency, meaning that if the function is given the same argurments it will always return the same result.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Functional programming is the use of pure functions to build more complex functions. I am intrigued by this style of programming because you get to start small and them use the pieces you built to create the whole picture.</p>
